jsonrpc-c
=========

JSON-RPC in C (server only for now)

What?
-----
A library for a C program to receive JSON-RPC requests on tcp sockets (no HTTP).

Free software, MIT license.

Why?
----
I needed a way for an application written in C, running on an embedded Linux system to be configured by
a Java/Swing configuration tool running on a connected laptop. Wanted something simple, human readable,
and saw no need for HTTP.

How?
----
It depends on libev http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html (was already used on the embedded app) and includes cJSON (with a small patch on my fork).
No further dependencies.

### Testing

Run `autoreconf -i`  before `./configure` and `make`

Test the example server by running it and typing: 

`echo "{\"method\":\"sayHello\"}" | nc localhost 1234`

or

`echo "{\"method\": \"add\", \"params\": [3,4], \"id\": \"SOME_IDENTIFIER\" }" | nc  localhost 1234`

or

`echo "{\"method\":\"exit\"}" | nc localhost 1234`
